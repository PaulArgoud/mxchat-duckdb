# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in **MxChat DuckDB / MotherDuck**, please report it privately so it can be fixed before details become public.

**Preferred channel** — open a private [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/PaulArgoud/mxchat-duckdb/security/advisories/new). This keeps the report confidential, lets us collaborate on a fix in a private fork, and produces a CVE-friendly disclosure trail.

**Email fallback** — `paul@argoud.net`. PGP available on request.

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue, post on social media, or discuss the vulnerability in a public chat until a patched release ships.

### What to include

A useful report contains, at minimum:

- The plugin version (`MXCHAT_DUCKDB_VERSION` in `mxchat-duckdb.php`).
- The affected backend (`embedded` or `motherduck`) and whether the PECL `duckdb` extension is loaded.
- A reproduction scenario — concrete enough that a developer can follow it on a clean WordPress install with `mxchat-basic` activated.
- The observed impact (read of data outside scope, write/delete without auth, remote code execution, etc.).
- A suggested fix, if you have one.

### What we commit to

- **Acknowledgement** of the report within **5 business days**.
- **Triage + impact assessment** shared back within **10 business days**.
- **Patched release** for confirmed vulnerabilities shipped as fast as the fix complexity allows — typically days for an isolated bug, longer if it touches the data layer or the upstream `mxchat-basic` integration.
- **Credit in the release notes** if you'd like (and a CVE filed when warranted), unless you prefer to stay anonymous.

## Scope

In scope:

- The plugin's REST endpoints under `/wp-json/mxchat-duckdb/v1/*` (Pinecone proxy + health).
- The admin AJAX handlers (`wp_ajax_*`) registered by the plugin.
- The WP-CLI commands (`wp mxchat-duckdb …`).
- The SQL construction in `Vector_Store`, `Vector_Store_Query`, `Vector_Store_Schema`, `Mysql_Sync`, `Compactor`, `Pinecone_Migrator`.
- The proxy authentication path (`MxChat_DuckDB_Pinecone_Proxy::check_token()`).
- The directory blockers written by `MxChat_DuckDB_Options::write_directory_blockers()`.

Out of scope (please report to upstream instead):

- Vulnerabilities in `mxchat-basic` itself — report to that project.
- Vulnerabilities in DuckDB, the DuckDB VSS extension, MotherDuck, or the PECL `duckdb` extension — report to those projects.
- Vulnerabilities in WordPress core — report via the [WordPress Security Team](https://wordpress.org/about/security/).
- Misconfiguration on the operator's side that isn't enabled by an unsafe plugin default (e.g. the operator running an HTTP-only site and exposing the `.duckdb` file because they bypassed the auto-written blockers).

## Supported versions

Only the latest **minor** release is supported with security fixes:

| Version | Status |
|---|---|
| 0.6.x | ✅ supported |
| 0.5.x | ⚠️ upgrade to 0.6.x |
| 0.4.x and below | ❌ unsupported |

The plugin is pre-1.0; expect the supported-version window to widen once the API is declared stable.

## Hardening defaults

The plugin ships with these protections enabled by default — disabling them is explicitly your choice:

- `.htaccess` + `index.php` + `web.config` blockers auto-written to the embedded data directory.
- Per-namespace REST tokens (random `bin2hex(random_bytes(24))`), constant-time comparison via `hash_equals()`.
- Per-namespace rate limit on the Pinecone-proxy REST endpoints (120 req/min by default).
- Nonce + `manage_options` capability check on every admin AJAX endpoint.
- Cascade-delete handler re-checks both the nonce and the capability before touching DuckDB.
- DuckDB CLI invocation uses `proc_open()` in array form (no shell) with a 30 s non-blocking deadline.
- `embedded_binary` setting probes the candidate path with a marker `SELECT` so a non-DuckDB binary (e.g. `/bin/sh`) surfaces a settings warning on save.
