/**
 * Mirrored connection: wraps a primary backend (MotherDuck cloud) and a
 * local DuckDB shadow, routing reads to local for HNSW speed and writes
 * to both in sequence (primary first, mirror best-effort) for durability.
 *
 * Implements the same MxChat_DuckDB_Connection interface as the
 * underlying connections, so callers don't need to know the wrapper
 * exists — Schema/Query/REST proxy/CLI all keep using the connection
 * exactly as before.
 *
 * Architecture rationale lives in docs/DESIGN-motherduck-mirror.md.
 * Short version:
 *   - Consistency model: synchronous write-through, primary-first.
 *     A user-facing call returns success when primary accepted the
 *     write; if the mirror fails afterwards, the SQL is queued for
 *     reconciliation (mirror_pending option) and the call still
 *     returns success.
 *   - Reads: route to local. On local failure (corruption, lock,
 *     disk error), fall back to primary for the rest of the request.
 *   - DDL: applies to both sides via the write-through path.
 *
 * The MVP queue stores `{sql, params}` pairs rather than the
 * `{vector_id}` shape originally sketched in the design doc — works
 * for any SQL kind (not just upserts) and avoids parsing the SQL to
 * extract IDs. Replaying the original statement is idempotent for the
 * INSERT OR REPLACE + DELETE writes the plugin actually performs.
